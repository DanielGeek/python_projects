# 🐍 DanielGeek's Python Projects

This repository showcases my journey and hands-on practice with Python — starting from the basics of syntax and control flow to more advanced topics like scoping, dictionaries, and testing with `pytest`. These exercises reflect my progressive mastery of Python through small, focused challenges and mini-projects.

## 🧠 Learning Roadmap

Organized by day, this repository follows a project-based learning style (inspired by 100 Days of Code and Bootcamp formats).

### ✅ Fundamentals & Data Types

- `1-day-1-printing` – Variables, printing, and f-strings.
- `2-day-1-variables` – Primitive data types and type conversion.
- `3-day-2-datat-ypes` – Tip calculator project.
- `4-day-3` – Conditional logic: Treasure Island game.
- `5-day-4-randomisation-python-lists` – Randomization and Rock-Paper-Scissors.
- `6-day-5-loops` – Loops and password generator.
- `7-day-7` – ASCII art and basic UI interaction.

### 🔐 Logic, Dictionaries & Scope

- `8-day-8` – Caesar cipher encoder/decoder with user input improvements.
- `9-day-9-dictionaries` – Using dictionaries for structured data.
- `10-day-10-function-outputs` – Function return values and flow control.
- `11-day-11` – Intro to testing and debugging logic.
- `12-day-12-scope` – Understanding local vs global scope in Python.

## 🧪 Testing & Real-World Projects

### 🧬 AIHR: Candidate Screening (Basic HR Automation)

- Folder: `13-AIHR`
- Simple data handling and logic to filter candidate profiles using Python.
- Includes unit testing using `pytest`.

```bash
pip install pytest
pytest
```
