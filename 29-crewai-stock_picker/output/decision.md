Perplexity AI was selected for investment due to its substantial growth, leading position in AI technology, and consistent performance, showing high investment potential. As a market leader processing over 435 million searches monthly, with a projected 800% YoY revenue growth, its robustness in the AI market suggests strong future prospects. In contrast, Liquid Death, despite innovative branding and notable market valuation at $951.5M, operates in a more volatile segment with budding expansion plans that are still being tested in new areas like energy drinks. Throxy, though innovative in AI sales with promising growth, remains in the early stages of funding and expansion within niche traditional industries, presenting a higher level of risk than Perplexity AI.
